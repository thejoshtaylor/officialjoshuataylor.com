# Summary

I created a custom integration to send commands to Home Assistant using physical buttons and indicate the status of the devices. The project involved designing and 3D printing a custom enclosure for the electronics and buttons. The buttons were connected to an Arduino microcontroller, which communicated with Home Assistant over serial. The status of the devices was indicated using LEDs inside the buttons.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a physical interface for controlling devices in Home Assistant. The physical buttons make it easy to control devices without needing to use a smartphone or computer. The LEDs inside the buttons provide feedback on the status of the devices, such as whether a switch is on or off.

# Features

- Custom 3D printed enclosure
- Physical buttons for controlling devices
- LEDs for indicating device status
- Arduino microcontroller for communication with Home Assistant
