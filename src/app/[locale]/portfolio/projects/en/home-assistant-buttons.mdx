I created a custom integration to send commands to Home Assistant using physical buttons and indicate the status of the devices. The project involved designing and 3D printing a custom enclosure for the electronics and buttons. The buttons were connected to an Arduino microcontroller, which communicated with Home Assistant over serial. The status of the devices was indicated using LEDs inside the buttons.
